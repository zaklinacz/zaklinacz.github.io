 <div><p>Hi! Hello!<br><br>
    Happy 6 months anniversary<3<br>As you probably already know I love you<br>more than anything in the world,I’m very grateful for meeting you<br> these few months ago, you changed my life and you’re my<br> everything ever since. There are many good things going our way<br> and I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you,<br> with your influence  I changed a lot during these 6 months and I really<br> enjoy that change. You taught me what it is to love and be loved, that life<br> is worth living and is actually pretty chill and fun.<br> Thank you that every time we hang out you make me feel <br>special and loved, I am never bored around you and everything <br>that is wrong in the world disappears, thank you.<br> Honestly I’m just very happy to be there with you.<br> Did I already tell you that I love you? Btw I love you, To be honest <br>I probably would love you even when you were a worm.<br> Yours forever and ever,<br> Stanislaus <3</p></div>
